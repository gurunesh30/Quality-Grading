"""Shared contract layer.

Every module in this package is a cross-branch dependency. Anything a
workstream branch needs from another workstream must be expressed here as a
type or a protocol, never as an import of that workstream's internals.

Authored so far:

- :mod:`agrigrade.core.enums`  - produce, family and grade vocabularies
- :mod:`agrigrade.core.errors` - exception hierarchy

Reserved, to be authored when the first consumer lands on ``main``:

- ``types.py``          - ``SegmentationResult``, ``FeatureVector``, ``GradeResult``
- ``feature_schema.py`` - canonical feature names, order and validation
- ``config.py``         - settings and schema versioning
